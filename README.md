# React Drum Machine

Welcome to the React Drum Machine project! This interactive web application allows you to play drum sounds using both mouse clicks and keyboard keys. It's a fun and engaging way to create beats and experiment with different sounds.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-drum-machine.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd react-drum-machine
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install
```



## Deployment to GitHub Pages

Once you have completed the installation, I encourage you to make it your own by updating the code and design to suit your preferences.


1. Update the "homepage" Link

In your project's package.json file, make sure the "homepage" link reflects the actual GitHub Pages URL where your project will be hosted. Locate the "homepage" field and update it with the actual URL of your GitHub Pages.

```bash
"homepage": "https://username.github.io/repository-name",
```


2. Build and Deploy

To build and deploy your project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command not only builds your project but also creates a `gh-pages` branch and pushes the latest changes to that branch. If you encounter any issues with deployment, make sure to check the repository settings and select the `gh-pages` branch in the **Pages** section.

## CodePen Prototype and FreeCodeCamp Certification

This project represents just one of the challenges within the Front-End Development Libraries Certification program by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

- [**View My FreeCodeCamp Front-End Development Libraries Certification**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/bade/front-end-development-libraries)

This React Drum Machine project initially started as a CodePen prototype due to the requirements of the FreeCodeCamp certification. FreeCodeCamp's test suite runs on CodePen, making it a suitable platform for meeting certification criteria.

You can explore the original CodePen version by following this link:
